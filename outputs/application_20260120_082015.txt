=== ATS OPTIMIZED RESUME ===
The provided candidate profile (Python developer with 2 years of experience) is not relevant to the job requirements for an Assistant or Associate Professor in Marine or Mechanical Engineering. The job necessitates extensive experience in teaching, sea service as a licensed engineer, or specific shipyard/power-plant operations, along with advanced degrees and professional licenses. A Python developer's skillset and experience do not align with these requirements, making it impossible to create an ATS-optimized resume tailored to this specific job description using the given candidate profile.

=== COVER LETTER ===
I am unable to generate a personalized cover letter for the Assistant or Associate Professor position in Marine or Mechanical Engineering based on the provided candidate profile.

The job requirements necessitate a strong background in teaching, significant sea service as a licensed engineer, or extensive experience in shipyard/power-plant operations, along with advanced degrees and relevant professional licenses. The candidate profile describes a Python developer with two years of experience.

There is a significant mismatch between the candidate's skillset and experience (Python development) and the essential qualifications for the academic position (Marine/Mechanical Engineering expertise, teaching, sea service, advanced degrees, professional licenses). Consequently, it is not possible to create a relevant or compelling cover letter that accurately reflects the candidate's qualifications for this specific role.
