=== ATS OPTIMIZED RESUME ===
The user wants an ATS-optimized resume for a candidate with "Python, FastAPI, SQL, 2 years experience" tailored to a job description that emphasizes general engineering principles, data analysis, problem-solving, communication, and specific biomedical engineering knowledge (GS-0858). The candidate profile is very brief, so I will need to make some assumptions and create a plausible resume structure that incorporates the required skills and experience level, while highlighting the candidate's technical skills in a way that aligns with the engineering context.

The job description focuses heavily on engineering principles, data interpretation, problem-solving, and documentation. The candidate's stated skills (Python, FastAPI, SQL) are technical and can be framed as tools used for data analysis, automation, and potentially backend development within an engineering context. The "2 years experience" needs to be mapped to the GS-7 or GS-9 level, which are education-heavy. Given the lack of specific degree information, I will assume a relevant Bachelor's degree for GS-7 and potentially some graduate study or equivalent experience for GS-9, focusing on the *application* of engineering principles.

I will structure the resume with:
1.  **Contact Information:** Standard.
2.  **Summary/Objective:** Tailored to highlight relevant skills and experience, aligning with the job's emphasis on engineering principles and data.
3.  **Skills:** A dedicated section to list keywords from the job description and the candidate's technical stack.
4.  **Experience:** This will be the most challenging part due to the limited candidate profile. I will create a plausible entry that showcases the application of Python, FastAPI, and SQL in a context that could be interpreted as engineering tasks (e.g., data analysis, automation, system development). I will frame the "2 years experience" to align with the GS-7/GS-9 requirements, focusing on tasks that demonstrate engineering principles.
5.  **Education:** I will include placeholders for a relevant degree and potentially graduate studies, as this is crucial for GS-7/GS-9. I will also include a note about Superior Academic Achievement if applicable.
6.  **Projects (Optional but Recommended):** If the candidate has personal projects that demonstrate engineering application of their skills, this would be beneficial. I will add a placeholder for this.

**ATS Optimization Strategy:**
*   **Keyword Integration:** Sprinkle keywords from the job description throughout the resume (e.g., "engineering principles," "data analysis," "problem-solving," "technical accuracy," "automated technology," "designs/drawings" if applicable to the candidate's experience).
*   **Clear Section Headings:** Use standard headings like "Summary," "Skills," "Experience," "Education."
*   **Quantifiable Achievements:** Where possible, use numbers to demonstrate impact (though this will be limited with the given profile).
*   **Standard Formatting:** Avoid complex tables, graphics, or unusual fonts. Use a clean, readable layout.
*   **Relevance:** Ensure every section and bullet point directly or indirectly relates to the job requirements.

Given the "GS series 0858" mention, I will try to subtly weave in concepts related to biomedical engineering or automated technology if the candidate's experience can be plausibly framed that way. However, without more information, this will be general.

Let's assume the candidate has a Bachelor's degree in a relevant field (e.g., Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or even a strong technical Bachelor's with relevant coursework) and has been working for 2 years. This could potentially qualify for GS-7 with SAA or GS-9 if they have significant graduate study or equivalent experience. I will aim for a GS-7/GS-9 level description.

**Drafting the Resume Content:**

*   **Summary:** Focus on analytical skills, problem-solving, technical proficiency (Python, FastAPI, SQL), and a commitment to engineering best practices.
*   **Skills:** Combine technical skills (Python, FastAPI, SQL) with soft skills and engineering concepts mentioned in the job description.
*   **Experience:** Create a role like "Software Engineer" or "Data Analyst" where Python, FastAPI, and SQL were used to automate processes, analyze data, or develop systems, linking these actions to engineering principles like efficiency, accuracy, and problem resolution.
*   **Education:** Placeholder for a Bachelor's degree and potentially graduate coursework.

I will create a resume that is generic enough to fit the limited candidate profile but specific enough in its language to target the job description.
